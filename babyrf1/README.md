# babyrf1 - Radio Frequency - 496 points - 10 solves
Welcome to the world of radio frequency! Before we give you real-life raw I/Q files and let you start hacking protocols, let's make sure you understand and can show basic competency in the fundamentals.

Note: challenges in this category are gated. Completion of babyrf 1 will unlock babyrf 2, and completion of babyrf 2 will unlock all the challenges in the RF category.

--- Hint ---

If you're still struggling with babyrf1 and begging for a sine,

Look at the data you've unpickled and then you'll be fine.

Digital cannot capture infinitely as much as analog a point,

So instead we have many samples discretely disjoint.

But one should look to see if they can recover analog waves that be

And once you find out then you'll realize how easy this challenge is to see.

Hint! The given data is pickled. This is not a part of the challenge. This is the standard way to marshall data in Python. You should unmarshall the data in the pickles. https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html. Hint! Please do not play the pickle in VLC.
