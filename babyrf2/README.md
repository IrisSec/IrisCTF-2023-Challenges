# babyrf2 - Radio Frequency - 499 points - 4 solves
Great job with babyrf 1! But what do we do if we have a really long string of 1s or a really long string of 0s? What kind of problem do we run into, and what kinds of solutions are there?

Note: challenges in this category are gated. Completion of babyrf 2 will unlock all the challenges in the RF category.

Hint! Once you finish babyrf1, you can very easily finish babyrf2 building off of that same codebase. Hint! If I sent a really long string of 0s via radio... I would have no idea how many 0s I actually sent! I wonder if there's some way to solve this without needing an additional clock signal, almost like a signal that could clock itself. Hint! Part 2's encoding scheme is a very standard scheme first created by IBM in 1956 by Bryon E. Phelps. It is not inherently self-clocking, but probabilistically achieves the same solution at lower precisions.
