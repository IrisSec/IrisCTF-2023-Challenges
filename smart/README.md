I made a small, efficient block cipher. It's small because I can fit it on the page and it's efficient because it only uses the minimal amount of rounds. I didn't even try it but I'm sure it works. Here's some output with the key. Can you get the flag back out?

I'm sure you'll never guess what comes next: Now do it without the key!
