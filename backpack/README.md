# backpack - Radio Frequency - 500 points - 0 solves
Sometimes I go around with a radio in my backpack and just see what I pick up.

Once you recover the message, wrap it with `irisctf{}` before submitting the flag.

**Important: do not attempt to retransmit any given transmissions unless you know what you are doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!**
