# Closet Computer - Reverse Engineering - 499 points - 5 solves
Closet Computer is a strange, unfinished game that released in 2072. Many critics complained that the game was too unoptimized, and it is! Supposedly, this bad boy holds hundreds of threads in it. Why? Who knows! See if you can escape the closet!

Note: In rare cases, the program can get stuck. If it seems like it's doing nothing for a long time, just restart it.
