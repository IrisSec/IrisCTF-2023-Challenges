# MICHAEL - Networks - 500 points - 1 solve
We had a rat infestation so I put mousetraps everywhere. Now I can code in peace without rats!

I'm a networks guy, so I was doing some network coding the other day when I picked up these interesting transmissions from some not-exactly-802.11 devices. There seems to be some presumably low-power wireless device somewhere transmitting data continuously, like a fountain! I think it's transmitting the flag, but I don't understand its transmissions. Can you recover it?

[Hint! Wireshark's protocol analyzer may be misleading. Analyze it yourself.]
[Hint! I can do network coding without rats. Ratless network coding!]
[Hint! I cannot stress this enough: Wireshark's protocol analyzer, and most tools' protocol analyzers, may mislead you. You should analyze the data yourself! The 802.15.4 sequence and src/dest format are very standard. What comes after? This challenge requires a lot of protocol analysis as well as a mathematical part at the end!]
