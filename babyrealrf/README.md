# babyrealrf - Radio Frequency - 500 points - 1 solve
Great job completing those babyrf challenges earlier. Now, we're moving from the theoretical domain into the real world! Let's get you started with real world RF.

My buddy sent me this file the other day of some signals he recorded. We think it holds the flag, but we're not sure what kind of file this is, nor do we have any idea how to open it! Do you think you could get the flag for us?

**Important: do not attempt to retransmit any given transmissions unless you know what you are doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!**

[Hint! Try learning tools that real radio hackers use. There are 2 major ones that we all use!]
