For this challenge you will need to submit a URL to the admin bot (a program that runs a browser and directs it to visit your URL, simulating a real person clicking your link). I recommend learning how to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) if you don't know how to expose local solutions to the internet - I've also provided a template server using Python and Flask for your solution.

[Hint! The admin's cookie is set with SameSite=None]
