# MyCoolSDK - 500 points - 2 solves
I've written a program that let's you encrypt and decrypt strings, but it uses a proprietary closed-source SDK through GitHub Actions. Of course you can fork it and only the magical GitHub black box will be able to see it. So there's no way you could dump the entire SDK... right?

Also after solving, please delete your repository if you fork and make any changes to it so others can't cheat off of your repo.

Hint: this is not a rev challenge. No need to break IDA out for this one.
