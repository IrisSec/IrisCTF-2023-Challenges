# monke - Radio Frequency - 500 points - 1 solve
Dog goes woof, cat goes meow, bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak. Cow goes moo, frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot. Ducks say quack, and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow ow ow! But there's one sound that no one knows.

What does the monkey say?

**Important: do not attempt to retransmit any given transmissions unless you know what you are doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!**
