# Needle in the Haystack Secure - Networks - 498 points - 7 solves
I saw my arch-nemesis, Billy Bob Bobertson, in the library. He left his laptop open for 3 minutes to go use the restroom. Luckily, I had my BadUSB handy and gave myself a shell and then persistent remote access, and started running a few commands and capturing his web traffic (shown in the attached screenshot). I think he's up to something suspicious and received some sort of message from a group of criminals.

They say that looking through a pcap is like finding a needle in a haystack, but what do you do if that haystack is encrypted?
