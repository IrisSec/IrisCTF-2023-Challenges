# Here In My Garage - Radio Frequency - 500 points - 0 solves
My arch-nemesis, Billy Bob Bobertson, just moved into a new house. I'm still upset at him for stealing my Pringles all those years ago -- my delicious lemon, cheese, and garlic Pringles! Let's break into Billy Bob Bobertson's house and steal his new Lamborghini parked in his garage. I hear they're a lot of fun to drive in the Hollywood hills.

I planted a secret radio receiver near his house and picked up some signals from when he parks in the garage. Unfortunately, it looks like the RF-based access mechanism he uses uses non-static codes, so I can't just replay a captured signal (unless I were to rolljam it, of course). There must be some way to break in!

Note: this challenge was set up using the unlicensed frequency spectrum. This is a resource shared by all. There may be other transmissions unrelated to the challenge due to other devices using the medium when these samples were recorded.

The flag format for this challenge is the sequence of bits required to be transmitted in order to *open* the garage. If there is a preamble, do not include it. If there are any frame header/trailer bits, do not include them. You may assume these bits will be retransmitted on the same frequency using the same modulation mechanism. If there are multiple correct answers, submit only the first. Wrap your answer with `irisctf{}`.

**Important: do not attempt to retransmit any given transmissions unless you know what you are doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!**
