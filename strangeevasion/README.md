# Strange Evasion - Forensics - 500 points - 0 solves
Fred found a suspicious new script on his computer, but he doesn't remember making or downloading it! He thinks that an attacker might have left it behind by accident. We have a capture of the network traffic going to and from his computer around the suspected time of the intrusion.

Our tools and scanners couldn't detect anything. Can you?
