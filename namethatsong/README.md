# Name that song
## Name that song - Misc - 417 points - 43 solves
Here's an IT song for you. The original title has been redacted. What was the original name of the song? Wrap the title in flag format, all lowercase. Any special characters and spaces should be replaced with an underscore. If the song's name was "Never Gonna Give You Up", type `irisctf{never_gonna_give_you_up}`.

[Hint! I did not change the contents of the song, I only removed the title. If you find a song that sounds similar but not exactly the same, it's not the same song!]

Another song for you - this time in mod format - but no instrument names for you to search up. Same flag format as last challenge.
