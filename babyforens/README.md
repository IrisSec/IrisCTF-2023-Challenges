# babyforens - Forensics - 50 points - 105 solves
Never done forensics before? No problem. Digital forensics is the branch of forensic science related to the investigation of digital data and media typically pertaining to cybercrime. We do a lot of work related to data and information theory, which includes file formats.

I took this picture a while ago, but I deliberately broke the file so that you can't view it! Muahaha! Find out where I was, what time I took that photo, and the serial number of my camera. Oh and I also left a secret in the picture for you to find.

The flag format for this challenge is `irisctf{latitude_longitude_epochtime_serial_secret}`. Express latitude and longitude in decimal format, *truncated* (not rounded) to two decimal places. Include the decimal dot. Negatives are allowed. For example, the road outside the white house, which has the coordinates 38°53'50.7"N 77°02'11.6"W, would be expressed as `38.89_-77.03`.
The serial number is the product's serial number from the manufacturer, found printed on the bottom of the camera.
